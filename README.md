Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository is a **comprehensive showcase of my hands-on labs and exercises**, tracking my growth from foundational cybersecurity concepts to advanced penetration testing and SOC operations.  

I am building expertise across multiple paths:  

- **PreSecurity (TryHackMe)** – foundational networking, Linux, and cyber hygiene.  
- **CyberSec101 (TryHackMe)** – beginner-level practical cybersecurity labs.  
- **SOC Level 1 & 2 (TryHackMe)** – Security Operations skills and incident handling.  
- **eJPT (eLearnSecurity)** – hands-on penetration testing labs.  

Each lab contains:  
- Step-by-step notes  
- Screenshots and evidence  
- Observations and key learnings
